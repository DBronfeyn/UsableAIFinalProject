# UsableAIFinalProject

This final project was for the Usable AI course at Indiana University. I analyzed and predicted performance for a future season for NBA players

I used data from Kaggle found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data

This repo has a csv dataset that was downloaded from the above Kaggle link that is read in by the final project python notebook. This python notebook can be run from start to finish and it includes the following sections

- Load Data
- Preliminary Analysis (EDA, Feature Engineering, and Data Preprocessing)
- Modeling Experiments
- Best and Final Model
- Analyze Results

After rerunning this notebook, you will get the same exact results that I had gotten when I previously had worked on this project.
